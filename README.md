# URL Converter

URL Converter is a Python application with a GUI built using PyQt5. It allows users to sanitize and unsanitize URLs, converting them between normal and obfuscated formats for security purposes.

## Features

- **Sanitize URLs**: Convert normal URLs into a sanitized format by replacing `.` with `[.]` and `http` with `hXXp`, preventing accidental clicks or link detection.
- **Unsanitize URLs**: Convert sanitized URLs back to their normal form for easy access.
- **Batch Processing**: Handle multiple URLs at once, supporting input lists of any length.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple GUI with clear buttons for sanitizing, unsanitizing, and clearing text.
